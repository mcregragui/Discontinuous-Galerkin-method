# Discontinuous Galerkin method
Implementation of the discontinuous Galerkin method as discibed by Bernardo Cockburn and Chi-Wang Shu in their papers intiteled "TVB Runge-Kutta local projection discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for conservation laws". 
This implementation is applied to solve the Euler Equation and, especially, Sod and Lax shock tube problem.
